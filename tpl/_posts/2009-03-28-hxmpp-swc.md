title: HXMPP SWC

The latest haXe release (2.03) includes experimental support for flash9+ swc output.
Which means you now can use our HXMPP library from actionscript3 without loosing haXe compiler performances improvements.
Before this was only possible by generating as3 code which was a bit tricky sometimes.

Download the current HXMPP-SWC from the link below if you are a AS3 developer who dont wants to get hands dirty with the haXe stuff (you propably should). The SWC only includes jabber-client related classes (as HXMPP also supports creating server components ).
Usage is straightforward. Here is an example.
