This is one of the very rare shots of our shitty, energy unfriendly hardware,
hosting the public jabber service,
Photo was taken by zmo at the last crash/reboot some days ago (someone drilled a electric cable, no USV!).  
( omputer left/below runs our jabber server)  
THX to the [0xFF](http://graz.funkfeuer.at/) for hosting!
