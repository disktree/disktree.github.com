title: HXMPP Personal Event Protocol
---
The next new XEP implemented by HXMPP is the Personal Eventing Protocol.

Abstract:
This specification defines semantics for using the XMPP publish-subscribe protocol to broadcast state change events associated with an instant messaging and presence account. This profile of pubsub therefore enables a standard XMPP user account to function as a virtual pubsub service, easing the discovery of syndicated data and event notifications associated with such an account.

You can communicate following information:

* **Mood:** User moods, such as whether a person is currently happy, sad, angy, or annoyed
* **GeoLocation:** Information about the current geographical or physical location
* **Activity:** Extended presence data about user activities
