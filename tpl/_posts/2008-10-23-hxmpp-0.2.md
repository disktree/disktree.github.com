title: HXMPP 0.2
---
I am very pleasant to announce version 0.2 of our jabber/xmpp library for building xmpp based clients and components.
Its written in haxe and cross targets flash9+, javascript, php and neko.
Haxe seems to be the a superb platform for this kind of thing, since it targets 2 very attractive platforms in the browser,
but can also create command line based applications like server-components or bots with very little to null difference in code.
The only thing that changes from platform to platform is the 'connection with xmpp server' implementation.
I dont have implemented BOSH so far, but you can use the included (invisible) flash9-socket-bridge for connecting to the server with browser applications through “nooormal” sockets.

Hope to see some nice applications!

I am currently working on a programable mutliuser chat bot named ZOD.
Visit haxe@conference.jabber.org, with luck, you may experience the impregnation of an artificial intelligence.
