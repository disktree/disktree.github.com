title: HXMPP 0.2.1 released
---
..introducing a lot of fixes and minor additions.
Sadly there are some important things on my TODO list missing for the planned version 0.3.

Currently i am using 3 experimental applications based on the library:

* A git respository bot, which sends chat messages after a succesful commit. (neko)

* A multi user chat bot. (neko)

* A multi user chat service at jabber.spektral.at. (flash9)
For now this is just an testing ui for hxmpps muc implementation. Theoretically you can use any jabber account for this, practically not, since most jabber servers does not provide a flash policy server to allow connections to a different domain.
Please bother your jabber server administrator to install one!!  
You can test your host for this with:
python -c ‘print “<policy-file-request/>%c” % 0′ | nc HOSTNAME 843
