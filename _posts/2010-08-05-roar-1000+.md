title: ROAR 1000+
---

ROAR, our public, XMPP powered media micro blog, broke the 1000th post barrier some days ago. My plan was to write a new version before that, but busy as (n)ever ..

The XMPP roboter seems to be pretty stable .. didnâ€™t get down since months.
.. runs on nekoVM using a sqlite database.

You can add roar@jabber.spektral.at to your roster to post non-anonymously and directly from you jabber client. The bot accepts your presence subscription automagically. To post simply send a chat message .. your input gets interpreted line by line (most jabber clients can create new lines by hitting ctrl+enter).

Currently following input is supported:

    Image links (URL has to end with .png, .jpg or .gif)
    YouTube videos (simply copy URL from the browser bar)
    Vimeo videos (simply copy URL from the browser bar)
    Ogg audio files ( .ogg -> html5 audio tag)
    Ogv video files ( .ogv -> html5 video tag)
    and of course http links which get a-hrefd
