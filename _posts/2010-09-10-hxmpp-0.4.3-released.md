title: HXMPP 0.4.3 released
---
Main changes:

<ul>
	<li>Now available on github: http://github.com/tong/hxmpp</li>
	<li>Packet-ID-collectors are processed before others
	Most XEPS do just single IQ packet get/set -> result/error requests, but cause of XMPPs pushing nature must also listen for requests from other entities.
	The new style allows to savely use id filters on outgoing packets and listeners in specific namespaces at the same time without conflict.
	The listeners wonâ€™t get called if the packets has a awaited id cause filterd and blocked before.
	</li>
	<li>WebSocket support for flash using javascript glue</li>
	<li>Well .. i am not aware of any XMPP server supporting websockets except of my own :-). This will be handy anyway since its works around the flash cross domain policy.</li>
	<li>ChatState notification fix</li>
	<li>Roster rewrite (was f* messy)</li>
	<li>Added TLS dependencies for flash and neko</li>
	<li>StartTLS (except neko, air)
		Use port 5222 for secure (and unsecure) connections now.
		For flash you need to set a -D TLS compiler flag.
	</li>
	<li>TLS flash socketbridge supports unsecure connections as well</li>
	<li>Added a flashpolicy server class (Needed for (socket based) filetransfers to a flash entities.
	</li>
	<li>fixes,fixes,fixes</li>
</ul>
