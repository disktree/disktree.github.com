title: HXMPP 0.2
---
I am very pleasant to announce version 0.2 of our jabber/xmpp library for building xmpp based clients and components. Its written in haxe and cross targets flash9+, js, php and nekoVM.

Haxe seems to be the a superb platform for this kind of thing, since it targets 2 very attractive platforms in the browser (flash, js), but can also create command line based applications like server-components or bots with very little to null difference in code. The only thing that changes from platform to platform is the socket implementation.
I dont have implemented BOSH so far, but you can use the included (invisible) flash9-socket-bridge for connecting to the server with js applications through “regular” sockets. Which has the drawback of the flash player dependency but gives a small (13k), stable connection manager that often feels much more reliable than hakish BOSH connections, at least in firebug;) And…, since disktree.net uses flash in most web based applications anyway, the dependency drawback is kinda irrelevant.

Check the demos in /demos/*.hx for usage.
Hope to see some nice applications! The possiblilities are endless!
