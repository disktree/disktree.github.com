title: Fax mayhem
---
Tape together a few sheets of black construction paper and start faxing to the targets. When the first page goes through, roll it back and tape it to the other end of your sheet to form an infinite loop of black construction paper.
Then sit back and watch the mayhem begin.
Use any and all fax machines at your availability - the more the merrier!

â€¦ LOL. I hope to get access to an analog fax machine soon.
