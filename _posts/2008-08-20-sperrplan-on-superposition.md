Follow this link for listening to audio tracks produced by myself in between somthing about 2004- 2006.  
The flash audio player is experimental work providing a basic mediaplayer framework for controlling audio/video content in flash via an external interface.  

From the project description:  
WMPE (short for web media player enviroment) is a javascript framework written in haXe to provide connectivity to and from mediaplayers emebed in websites.  

It provides external interface connections:  
* to flash9+ mediaplayers.
* from mediaplayers to controls (flash or html)

The pros of this approach:
* less loading, no need to embed multiple swf-playback engines.
* centralized audio playback.
* centralized configuration.
* centralized playlist management.
* (sidebar player)

To the title of this blog post: The tracks were produced under the (inactive) music-label sperrplan. Superposition is an upcoming music project from a friend of mine ( for which the player engine gets developed ).
