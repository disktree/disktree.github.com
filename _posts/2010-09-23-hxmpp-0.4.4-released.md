SOCKS5 Bytestreams

Temporarily creates a socket server to which the recieving entity connects and handshakes using the SOCKS5 protocol.
Full support on neko, cpp, nodejs, air; flash supports file recieving only.
No support on php since it would block the XMPP stream.

    Inband bytestreams

Data gets split into chunks, base64 encoded and sent inband in the XMPP stream. This should only get used as last ressort if socket bytestreams fail or are not supported.
.. Supported on all HXMPP targets.

SITransfer/SIListener classes are used to negotiate the transfer method to use (XEP).

An example iâ€™ve used to test the implementation is available in the hxmpp.examples repository.
