HXMPP 0.4.4 add support for datatransfer using 2 different transports: 
 
{% include break.html %}

* **SOCKS5 Bytestreams**  
 Temporarily creates a socket server to which the recieving entity connects and handshakes using the SOCKS5 protocol.
 Full support on neko, cpp, nodejs, air; flash supports file recieving only.
 No support on haXe/php since it would block the XMPP stream (no threads).

* **Inband bytestreams**  
 Data gets split into chunks, base64 encoded and sent inband in the XMPP stream.
 This should only get used as last ressort if socket bytestreams fail or are not supported.
 All haxe compiler targets support this transport.

{% include break.html %}

[SITransfer](http://hxmpp.disktree.net/doc/api/types/jabber/data/SITransfer.html)/[SIListener](http://hxmpp.disktree.net/doc/api/types/jabber/data/SIListener.html) classes are used to negotiate the transfer method to use ([XEP](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0096.html)).  
An example iâ€™ve used to test the implementation is available in the hxmpp.examples repository.
