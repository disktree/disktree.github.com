title: HXMPP SWC

The latest haXe release (2.03) includes experimental support for flash9+ swc output.
Which means you now can use our HXMPP library from actionscript3 without loosing haXe compiler performances improvements.
Before this was only possible by generating as3 code which was a bit tricky sometimes.
