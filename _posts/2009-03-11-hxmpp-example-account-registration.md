title: HXMPP example - account registration
---
Based on HXMPP iâ€™ve created a simple example of a web based jabber account registration form. Intention for this is to get used on any user registration where an (additional) jabber account should get created too. The application compiles seamlessly to flash9+ and javascript (flash plugin required for the socket connection) and got tested against openfire and ejabberd.

Note: UI is pretty rough, just for testing purposes.
Note: A list of free jabber services.
Note: Use firebug to show the transfered XMPP.

BTW: HXMPP 0.3 got released some days ago and is available at code.google.
