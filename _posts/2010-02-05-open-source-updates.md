Latest experiments on disktrees opensource front …

    HXMPP.console
    A themeable XMPP transfer console for HXMPPs browser targets (screenshot). Long live my eyes!
    HXMPP.test
    Moved unit tests into a seperate repo and added some more tests.
    HXMPP SASL-MD5
    SASL authentication using MD5 is finally working.
    Uff, the bug was in the ‘removeNullDigits’ method of the base64 decoder; arrg, who would have thought it.
    HXMPP jingle
    Added experimental jingle/RTMP support for flash.
    Allows you to negotiate RTMP streams between jabber entities, aka: make video phone calls in the browser.
    SCM/Jabber roboter
    A jabber bot for (presence based) source control repository update notifications. Just git support right now.
    WebSocket server
    A simple, standalone, hx/neko websocket server, just for testing purposes.
    Google chrome extension external JS wrapper
    ..can be found in disktrees core library.
    Google chrome content script haXe remoting
    haXe remoting for contentscript 2 website (and vice versa) communication.
    LOKI
    Google chrome extension to add XMPP client functionality to the browser. Pretty useless implementation up to the point where it makes some sense ~#~#~
    hype-framework
    Generated, external haXe classes for the (AS3) hype framework.
    As far as i’ve stumbled cross the source code the framework feels pretty well organized, easy to use. Good for designers i think, but no plans to use it here right now.
