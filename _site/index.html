<p>Temporarily creates a socket server to which the recieving entity connects and handshakes using the SOCKS5 protocol.
Full support on neko, cpp, nodejs, air; flash supports file recieving only.
No support on php since it would block the XMPP stream.</p>

<pre><code>Inband bytestreams
</code></pre>

<p>Data gets split into chunks, base64 encoded and sent inband in the XMPP stream. This should only get used as last ressort if socket bytestreams fail or are not supported.
.. Supported on all HXMPP targets.</p>

<p>SITransfer/SIListener classes are used to negotiate the transfer method to use (XEP).</p>

		<div class="title">HXMPP 0.4.3 released</div>
		<div class="meta">10 Sep 2010</div>
		<div class="content"><p>Main changes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Now available on github: http://github.com/tong/hxmpp</li>
    <li>Packet-ID-collectors are processed before others
    Most XEPS do just single IQ packet get/set -> result/error requests, but cause of XMPPs pushing nature must also listen for requests from other entities.
    The new style allows to savely use id filters on outgoing packets and listeners in specific namespaces at the same time without conflict.
    The listeners won’t get called if the packets has a awaited id cause filterd and blocked before.
    </li>
    <li>WebSocket support for flash using javascript glue</li>
    <li>Well .. i am not aware of any XMPP server supporting websockets except of my own :-). This will be handy anyway since its works around the flash cross domain policy.</li>
    <li>ChatState notification fix</li>
    <li>Roster rewrite (was f* messy)</li>
    <li>Added TLS dependencies for flash and neko</li>
    <li>StartTLS (except neko, air)
        Use port 5222 for secure (and unsecure) connections now.
        For flash you need to set a -D TLS compiler flag.
    </li>
    <li>TLS flash socketbridge supports unsecure connections as well</li>
    <li>Added a flashpolicy server class (Needed for (socket based) filetransfers to a flash entities.

* Full adobe air2 support (including native, secure air2 socket connections).
* Added support for websocket connections (javascript only)
* Minor fixes</p>

<p>HXMPP.lop test implementation
The LOP stuff is in the HXMPP repo since months, this is just an example usage.
The application consists of a javascript villein (a anonymous XMPP client) living in the browser and a farm running on the nekoVM. The villein spawns hscript virtual machines on the farm, sends some script .. the farm computes it and sends back the result. Variables live as long until the VM gets killed by the villein.</p>

<p>OWL
A XMPP server running on nodejs.
The project is in a very early state but already doing basic internal instant messaging (no S2S). I am f* enjoying the development process, since i got a good overview on the XMPP protocol over the last couple of years (time goes by in ludicrous speed) while developing the client library and don’t have to read XMPP specs that much .. straight forward coding .. this will change when i get to the S2S stuff. brrr.
Of course written in haXe using the nodejs type signatures from blackdog and (currently) a redis backend.
This project accepts and encourages contributions!
Ping me: xmpp://tong@jabber.spektral.at</p>

<p>Tsunami
A small framework for navigating on websites without reloading using #s (hashes). This is forked from the serverside mtwin templo library.
Here is an example (src).
What sux is that webkit based browser destroy pending XHR requests on hash tag URL changes therefore it breaks BOSH connections -> fail! Firefox does it right.</p>

HXMPP jingle
Added experimental jingle/RTMP support for flash.
Allows you to negotiate RTMP streams between jabber entities, aka: make video phone calls in the browser.

WebSocket server
A simple, standalone, hx/neko websocket server, just for testing purposes.
Google chrome extension external JS wrapper
..can be found in disktrees core library.
Google chrome content script haXe remoting
haXe remoting for contentscript 2 website (and vice versa) communication.
LOKI
Google chrome extension to add XMPP client functionality to the browser. Pretty useless implementation up to the point where it makes some sense ~#~#~
hype-framework
Generated, external haXe classes for the (AS3) hype framework.
As far as i’ve stumbled cross the source code the framework feels pretty well organized, easy to use. Good for designers i think, but no plans to use it here right now.

		<div class="title">HaXe/XMPP remoting</div>
		<div class="meta">01 Dec 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>I have added a (async) haXe remoting remix to the HXMPP library using XMPP as transport, and created following example to test it:
[ HXR flash example ]</p>

<p>The app:
* embeds the same SWF twice in a HTML site
* the SWF logs into the jabber server with passed account information using SASL-MD5 authentication (password is hidden)
* creates an instance of the application
* create a haXe remoting host in context of the instance to listen for incoming calls.
* create a haXe remoting proxy in context of the instance for outgoing calls.
* on button click:
<strong> creates random values for the next circle to add to the other entities canvas
</strong> adds a circle to the remote entities canvas by calling a function on the proxy</p>

<p>A great benefit of HXR (haXe-remoting) over XMPP is that EVERY entitiy/target, also clients, can act as remote host. Which means i can call methods on a client from any other entity (a server or another client). Pretty cool for round based games and stuff.</p>

<p>Important thing missing is a access model for the remote host.
Currently every entity is allowed to call methods.
(Workaround would be be to add a IQ/HXR filter to block remaing packet collectors)</p>

		<div class="title">Apache/Openfire BOSH setup</div>
		<div class="meta">19 Oct 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>Since HXMPP supports BOSH connections (flash/js) it’s time to write a little setup instruction….
In my (local) case for apache2/openfire 3.6.4 on ubuntu 9.04.
What has to be done is to be able to connect your client to the BOSH adress of your jabber server. Default on openfire is http://localhost:7070/http-bind/</p>

<p>Your apache server doesn’t know about your jabber server, so you have to setup a proxy to forward requests:
http://localhost/jabber/ > http://localhost:7070/http-bind/</p>

<p>Here we go:</p>

<h1>Activate the mod_proxy apache module if required</h1>

<p>sudo ln /etc/apache2/mods-available/proxy.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled</p>

<h1>Add following line to proxy.load for loading the module</h1>

<p>LoadModule proxy_http_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_http.so</p>

<h1>Add the proxy directive to the host settings in your http.conf</h1>

<p>ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPass /jabber http://localhost:7070/http-bind/
ProxyPassReverse /jabber http://localhost:7070/http-bind/
ProxyPass /jabbers http://localhost:7443/http-bind/
ProxyPassReverse /jabbers http://localhost:7443/http-bind/</p>

<h1>Restart apache</h1>

<p>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>

<p>Thats it!
Using HXMPP, you can now create a connection by passing in the path in the constructor, like:
var cnx = new BOSHConnection( “myjabberserver.net”, “127.0.0.1/jabber/” );</p>

		<div class="meta">09 Oct 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>While adding support for wrapping media files into the according html5 tag (audio or video) to my realtime microblogging application at roar.disktree.net i discovered a nasty situation as follows:
How to know if a file with the ‘.ogg’ extension is video rather than audio from within javascript ?</p>

<p>Possible workarounds to distinguish (in case of my application):</p>

<pre><code>Read the file header serverside and save the result somewhere.
Ok, but requires extra work.
Try to discover filetype from the ID3 tag.
Not save.
Read the file header in flash (which is able to read data at byte level).
Ok for files served from same domain only.
</code></pre>

<p>Anyhow, no solution for javascript, so it would be good to agree on:
Name audio files ‘ogg’, video files ‘.ogv’ and tell everybody to do so!</p>

<p>Or am i overlooking something ?</p>

It uses anonymous authentication, which allows to consume it without logging into a jabber account.</p>

<p>haXe really unfolds its power for this project since i target 4 different platforms from one language and use the same jabber library clientside and for the commandline bot. Flash for the jabber client, JS for printing html, PHP for delivering HTML and nekoVM for the jabber bot.</p>

<p>Go test it:

		<div class="title">WeFeelFine jabber bot</div>
		<div class="meta">22 Apr 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>I’ve created a jabber bot for the WeFeelFine API.</p>

<p>Bots presence:</p>

<p>We Feel Fine is an exploration of human emotion on a global scale.
Since August 2005, We Feel Fine has been harvesting human feelings from a large number of weblogs. Every few minutes, the system searches the world’s newly posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases “I feel” and “I am feeling”. When it finds such a phrase, it records the full sentence, up to the period, and identifies the “feeling” expressed in that sentence (e.g. sad, happy, depressed, etc.)</p>

<p>You can add ﻿wefeelfine@jabber.spektral.at to your contact list and request the bot with chat (or normal type) messages like:</p>

<p>returnfield, returnfield,… $ option=value+option=value+…</p>

<p>..where the returnfields specifiy the data which should get loaded (sentence is default).
Possible returnfields are:</p>

<pre><code>imageid
feeling
posttime
postdate
posturl
gender
born
country
state
city
lat
lon
conditions
</code></pre>

<p>Key-value pairs after ‘$’  specify optional settings, which are:</p>

<pre><code>limit=0-1500 (num feelings to return)
feeling=a-z (specify feeling)
gender=0/1 (0=female,1=male)
conditions=1-4 (1=sunny, 2=rainy, 3=snowy, 4=cloudy)
counry=a-z
state=a-z
city=a-z
postdate=date (YYYY-MM-DD)
postmonth=1-12
postyear=0-2009
</code></pre>

<p>The bot will return 5 values if no ‘limit’ options is specified.
Type ‘help’, ‘fields’ or ‘options’ to display the possible request fields.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>“Give me the most recent 5 sentences from vienna”:
$city=vienna</p>

<p>“Give me the last two sentences from people in canada who feel loved”:
$limit=2 + feeling=loved + state=canada</p>

<p>“Give me the last 3 sentences plus city, gender, latitude and longitude from people in paris who feel angry”:
city,gender,lat,lon $ limit=3 + city=paris + feeling = angry</p>

		<div class="title">HXMPP Personal Event Protocol</div>
		<div class="meta">04 Apr 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>The next new XEP implemented by HXMPP is the Personal Eventing Protocol.</p>

<p>Abstract:
This specification defines semantics for using the XMPP publish-subscribe protocol to broadcast state change events associated with an instant messaging and presence account. This profile of pubsub therefore enables a standard XMPP user account to function as a virtual pubsub service, easing the discovery of syndicated data and event notifications associated with such an account.</p>

<p>You can communicate following information:</p>

<pre><code>Tune: Communicate information about music to which a user is listening.
Mood: User moods, such as whether a person is currently happy, sad, angy, or annoyed.
GeoLocation: Information about the current geographical or physical location.
Activity: Extended presence data about user activities.
</code></pre>

		<div class="title">HXMPP Publish Subscribe</div>
		<div class="meta">03 Apr 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>Today i’ve added PubSub support to our HXMPP library.
Pubsub is a notification system like web syndication (RSS, Atom, ..) for the XMPP protocol with some great advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Realtime. Unlike regular web syndication, pubsub is a pushing system.
As soon as a new item is published at a node, the service notifies all registered subscribers. This is the last hurdle (in terms of time) evolution of global information technology is overcoming by delivering information for human unrecognizeable delays (millisecondes). Unlike rss, email,.. more like global smoke signals. )</p></li>
<li><p>Bandwith. New information is pushed only once.
Assume you have 50 feeds on your watchlist and every feed is about 10k in size and gets polled every 30 mins (the default configuration time in my RSS-reader), .. you end up having 1mb polled in 1h (720mb/month) mostly for /dev/null space since a lot of feeds just update in day intervals. This produces unecassery cost$ if you don’t have a flatrate connection (keyword mobile). Not to mention the extra costs for network transfer at servers (and power consumption)!</p></li>
<li><p>Configuration is built into the service itself, not in the software you use for.
Publishers are able to config their service to their needs (like: manage subscription requests, cache items, not routing events to offline storage, block users,..).
Subscribers can config their subscriptions, for example: to get just the title of the published data (bandwith again!) or to set the presence types which are allowed to receive notifications.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall the current system (RSS stuff) is doing it completely wrong and hopefully gets dropped and replaced by pubsub like systems very soon!</p>

		<div class="title">HXMPP SWC</div>
		<div class="meta">28 Mar 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>The latest haXe release (2.03) includes experimental support for flash9 SWC output. Which means you now can use our HXMPP library from actionscript3 without loosing haXe compiler performances improvements. Before this was only possible by generating as3 code which was a bit tricky sometimes.</p>

<p>Download the current HXMPP-SWC from the link below if you are a AS3 developer who dont wants to get hands dirty with the haXe stuff (you propably should). The SWC only includes jabber-client related classes (as HXMPP also supports creating server components ).
Usage is straightforward. Here is an example.</p>

		<div class="title">Pasteboard upgrade</div>
		<div class="meta">25 Mar 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>I’ve upgraded our pasteboard application. Beside a rewrite of the web front and server code i’ve added functionality to paste via jabber ( built with HXMPP targeting nekoVM ):</p>

<p>How to normal type message paste:
Type your language name into the subject.
Type your code into the body.</p>

<p>How to chat type message paste (in case your client does not support ‘normal’ type messages, like pidgin or the gtalk web widget ):
Send: language$$$code</p>

<p>Mind: The account has to be in your roster (accepts all presence subscriptions automaticly). On success the bot responds with message including the URL to your fresh, syntax highlighted paste. If the language is unkown your input gets filed under plaintext.</p>

<p>The used codehighlighter script by Joakim Ahnfelt also got an update and now supports: html, xml, javascript, php, css, perl, ruby, c, c++, c#, java, scala, haxe, python, haskell, latex, plus a few obscure languages.</p>

		<div class="meta">11 Mar 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>Based on HXMPP i’ve created a simple example of a web based jabber account registration form. Intention for this is to get used on any user registration where an (additional) jabber account should get created too. The application compiles seamlessly to flash9+ and javascript (flash plugin required for the socket connection) and got tested against openfire and ejabberd.</p>

<p>Note: UI is pretty rough, just for testing purposes.
Note: A list of free jabber services.
Note: Use firebug to show the transfered XMPP.</p>

		<div class="title">Tong defined</div>
		<div class="meta">14 Jan 2009</div>
		<div class="content"><p>A Tong can perhaps be defined as a mutual benefit society for people with a common interest which is illegal or dangerously marginal—hence, the necessary secrecy.
If a Tong is organized around a special interest (especially an illegal or risky or marginal interest) it certainly has the right to compose itself according to the “affinity group” principle. If secrecy means (a) avoiding publicity &amp; (b) vetting possible members, the “secret society” can scarcely be accused of violating anarchist principles. In fact, such societies have a long &amp; honorable history in the anti-authoritarian movement…
Many non-authoritarian organizations have foundered on the dubious principle of open membership, which frequently leads to a preponderance of assholes, yahoos, spoilers, whining neurotics, &amp; police agents.
Some will call this an elitist attitude, but it is not—at least not in the C. Wright Mills sense of the word: that is, a small group which exercises power over non-insiders for its own aggrandizement. Immediatism does not concern itself with power-relations;—it desires neither to be ruled nor to rule. The contemporary Tong therefore finds no pleasure in the degeneration of institutions into conspiracies. It wants power for its own purposes of mutuality. It is a free association of individuals who have chosen each other as the subjects of the group’s generosity, its “expansiveness” (to use a sufi term). If this amounts to some kind of “elitism,” then so be it.</p>

		<div class="title">HXMPP 0.2.1 released</div>
		<div class="meta">09 Dec 2008</div>
		<div class="content"><p>..introducing a lot of fixes and minor additions.
Sadly there are some important things on my TODO list missing for the planned version 0.3.</p>

<p>Currently i am using 3 experimental applications based on the library:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A git respository bot, which sends me ( and just me.lol ) a message after a succesful commit. (neko)</p></li>
<li><p>A multi user chat bot. (neko)</p></li>
<li><p>A multi user chat service at jabber.spektral.at. (flash9)
For now this is just an testing ui for hxmpps muc implementation. Theoretically you can use any jabber account for this, practically not, since most jabber servers does not provide a flash policy server to allow connections to a different domain.
Please bother your jabber server administrator to install one !!
You can test your host for this with:
python -c ‘print “<policy-file-request/>%c” % 0′ | nc HOSTNAME 843</p></li>
</ul>


<p>A simple example of using the library from plain js ( with a precompiled js ) can be found here.</p>

Test for flashplay10, with flash.Vector instead of Array:

		<div class="title">HXMPP 0.2</div>
		<div class="meta">23 Oct 2008</div>
		<div class="content"><p>I am very pleasant to announce version 0.2 of our jabber/xmpp library for building xmpp based clients and components. Its written in haxe and cross targets flash9+, js, php and nekoVM.</p>

<p>Haxe seems to be the a superb platform for this kind of thing, since it targets 2 very attractive platforms in the browser (flash, js), but can also create command line based applications like server-components or bots with very little to null difference in code. The only thing that changes from platform to platform is the socket implementation.
I dont have implemented BOSH so far, but you can use the included (invisible) flash9-socket-bridge for connecting to the server with js applications through “regular” sockets. Which has the drawback of the flash player dependency but gives a small (13k), stable connection manager that often feels much more reliable than hakish BOSH connections, at least in firebug;) And…, since disktree.net uses flash in most web based applications anyway, the dependency drawback is kinda irrelevant.</p>

<p>Check the demos in /demos/*.hx for usage.
Hope to see some nice applications! The possiblilities are endless!</p>
